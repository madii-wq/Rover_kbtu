<h1>Requirements</h1>
<h2>Functional requirements</h2>
<ol>
    <li>System must provide autonomous drive</li>
    <li>Make some laboratory experiments</li>
    <li>Drill soils</li>
    <li>Make simple manipulation</li>
    <li>All this actions must be controlled by envirenment signals and processing of images</li>
</ol>

<p>According this requirements we can divide out system into solvable subsystem. Subsystem is set of physical devices, control systems, communication systems, software and user interface. Our system consist of following subsystems. For easy navigation we add references</p>
<ol>
    <li>Motor drive system = wheel + conroller</li>
    <li>Energy source and BMS</li>
    <li>Image processing system = sensors + software</li>
    <li>Drilling system = drill + controller</li>
    <li>Manipulator = servos + controller</li>
</ol>
